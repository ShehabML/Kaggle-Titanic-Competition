we notice that we have missing data in Age, Cabin, Embarked,Fare.
** fare is only missing 1 value from test set 

## will fill missing in Age,Embarked ,Fare with values from the set 
## but Cabin will leave it as None as it may lead us to something 

we notice from the training set  plots:
1- about 60% or so didn't survive 
2- most of the people from Class 3 didn't make it, while more percentage from class 1 survived and a little from class 2
3- names need more inspuction later on as it has titles which coule be relevant
4- most males died while most females survived which suggests that they rescued kids and women first
5- Age follows a normal dist.will need to see bins dist.
6- most of those who had no SibSp didn't make it, anyone who had 3 to 4 probably didn't make it , anyone who had 5 or more didn't make it
might bin the number of relatives to some thing like (0-2-5-10) and 1 is the most ideal for surviving
7- having 1 or 2 PArCH is better for survivng as most of who had 0 didnt survive and all who 4 or more mostly died
8-Ticket needs to be further inspected 
9- fare needs to be futher inspected too
10-most of the None cabin died, also might try to split at letters for cabins
11- most of the embarked S died while more from C survived



#######
